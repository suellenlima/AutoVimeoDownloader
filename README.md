1. Open development console (Chrome: F12).
1. Go to the Network tab.
1. Right click on the `master.json` request, select Copy â†’ Copy link address. An example of how such a URL could look like:

`https://105vod-adaptive.akamaized.net/exp=1686796657~acl=%2F45a16a0c-e390-4a92-9f74-56b84224f6e8%2F%2A~hmac=9ba83ac69819e0794023357dd15b9bdce58da79055f2ccfd5f216b1e6eb21f9a/45a16a0c-e390-4a92-9f74-56b84224f6e8/sep/video/54e87bf0,a581f2f1,dfd03df0,e7ce4e25,fb1e4dac/audio/9e7a4006,a5dfb6c4,f35fcfa7/master.json?base64_init=1\u0026query_string_ranges=1`.


Create a TSV file (In Google Sheets or Excel save the file with format "Text (tab delimited) (*.txt)" in the same folder as the python script), where the first column is output file name (ending with `.mp4`) and the second is this URL to `master.json`.

Then run the script, providing the name of this file with names and URLs in VS Code (install extension python):

Example:
```bash
C:/Python312/python.exe "c:/AutoVimeoDownloader/main.py" -i names_urls.txt
```
